# Polymorphism

- Polymorphism in Go is achieved with the help of interfaces. As we have already discussed, interfaces can be implicitly implemented in Go. A type implements an interface if it provides definitions for all the methods declared in the interface.

- Polymorphism using interface:
    - A variable of type interface can hold any value which implements the interface. This property of interfaces is used to achieve polymorphism in Go.
