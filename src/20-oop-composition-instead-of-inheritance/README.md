# Composition instead of inheritance

## Notes:

- Go does not support inheritance, however it does support composition. The generic definition of composition is "put together".

- Composition can be achieved in Go is by embedding on ```struct``` type into another.

- It is not possible to anonymously embed a slice. A field name is required.
