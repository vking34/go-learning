# Variables

## Declaration
__var name type__ is the syntax to declare a single variable.

## Note
- Go will automatically be able to infer the type of that variable using that initial value.
- Short hand syntax can only be used when __at least one__ of the variables on the left side of := is newly declared.
- Since Go is __strongly typed__, variables declared as belonging to one type cannot be assigned a value of another type.
