## Running a go program

1. ```go install <package>```: compile the program and copy the binary to ```~/go/bin```
2. ```go build```: compile the current package and create the binary there
3. ```go run```: compile the program to a temporary location and runs the file from that location.
    - using ```-work``` flag to know the location.
